# abConduct_iOS

An iOS application for creating Scores with the abcnotation format, including the ability to create parts from the different voices of the full score and providing all as pdf-files through a webDAV server to the local network. 

I am a music teacher, musician in at least three active bands and I imagine myself with for example an orchestra in school playing scores I wrote diplayed on iPads connected to this app via a WebDav capable app. Suddently we notice a fault in the score or it needs to be changed a little bit for some pupil being not able to play what wrote for him.  Ok, Kids, have a sip from your water while I change the line, refresh, and, dear kid, will you please reload your file, - here we can go on...

Of course this scenario is part of the future, but still you can imagine a lot of other situation for ensembles that might profit from this app.

Users have to be familiar with the abcnotation format, more info here: http://abcnotation.com/ and all features here: http://moinejf.free.fr/abcm2ps-doc/index.html

With the underlying http://abcnotation.com/wiki/abc:standard:v2.2 it is possible to write highly professional scores.
