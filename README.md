# abConduct_iOS

An iOS application for creating Scores with the abcnotation format.
Includes the ability to create parts and providing all through a webDAV server to the local network.
You can also Playback all as midi optionally with your favourite sf2 soundfont.

### What for?

When I working as a music teacher in schools we were playing scores I wrote that were displayed on iPads or tablets connected to this WebDav capable app. When somebody noticed a fault in the score or it needed to be changed a little bit for some pupil being not able to play what wrote for him I could immediatly change the score.

### Usage

You have to be familiar with the [abcnotation format](http://abcnotation.com/) to write scores.
All members need to share the same local network then simply turn on the http-server and share the link.

With the underlying http://abcnotation.com/wiki/abc:standard:v2.2 it is possible to write highly professional scores.
